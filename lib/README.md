# Project: Labradoodle or Fried Chicken? 

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

data_cleaning.R : make sure everyone is using the same naming system and cleaning techniques in this project.

                  transpose the data to make columns denoting features and rows denoting pictures.
                  
                  the last column is the label, 0 is chicken, 1 is dog.
